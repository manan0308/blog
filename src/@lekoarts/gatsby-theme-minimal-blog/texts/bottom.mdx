## [InternFinder](https://twitter.com/internfinder)

InternFinder is a twitter bot built on Node.js that helps people find internships off Twitter. InternFinder was launched on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/internfinder) and hit 100+ upvotes within 24 hours. It reached 1500 followers (and counting ) on Twitter within 6 months of launch and helped me make my first 1000 rupees on the Internet.
