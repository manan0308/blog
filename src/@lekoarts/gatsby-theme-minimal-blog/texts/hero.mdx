# Hi.
I am Manan - A third year mechatronics engineering undergrad at MIT Manipal.

I have previously worked as a [PM Intern at Bounce](https://www.mananagarwal.in/pm-internship-at-bounce-learnings-and-the-experience) and a [Growth Intern at SpringWorks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mananagarwal03_internship-startups-bangalore-activity-6615235098830827520-Gsql).

At college, I lead the Business and Public Relations team at Manipalâ€™s largest media organization, [Manipal The Talk Network](https://www.manipalthetalk.org/).

I spend my time reading, [writing](https://www.mananagarwal.in/blog) and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/manan_0308).

When I am not doing the above, I can be found playing Call of Duty or finding new excel shortcuts.
