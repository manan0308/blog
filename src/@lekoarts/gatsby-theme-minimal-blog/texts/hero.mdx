# Hi.
I am Manan Agarwal, a Gen-Z based out of Mumbai, India. 

I used to work as a Product Manager at Razorpay in the [RazorpayX Payroll team](https://razorpay.com/payroll/) where I spent 2+ years building and scaling the product, as well as building our enterprise feature suite.

I have previously spent time across the Indian Startup ecosystem as a [PM Intern at Bounce](https://www.mananagarwal.in/pm-internship-at-bounce-learnings-and-the-experience), a [Growth/Founder's Office Intern at SpringWorks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mananagarwal03_internship-startups-bangalore-activity-6615235098830827520-Gsql) apart from all the side project tinkering.

I graduated from Manipal Institue of Technology with a robotics engineering degree. At college, I used to lead the Business and Public Relations team at Manipalâ€™s largest media organization, [Manipal The Talk Network](https://www.manipalthetalk.org/). 

Prior to that I also spent a significant time handling the management vertical whilst building a cool Mars Rover at [Mars Rover Manipal](http://marsrovermanipal.com/)

When I am not doing the above, I can be found playing Valorant, flying planes on my flight sim setup or reading spy fiction, if I am not wrecking my brains over a 1000 part jigsaw puzzle.
