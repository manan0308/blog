## 🧐 What's inside?

This website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the [Minimal Blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) theme by LekoArts. It features:

- A clean, typography-driven design
- Blog posts written in MDX
- Google Analytics integration (UA and GA4)
- SEO optimization
- Offline support
- Deployed on Netlify

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code
- `content/`: Holds the MDX files for blog posts and pages
- `static/`: For static assets like images
- `gatsby-config.js`: Main configuration file for Gatsby
- `package.json`: NPM package file

## 📝 Content Management

Blog posts and pages are written in MDX format. I use [this Google Docs add-on](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) to convert Google Docs to markdown for easy content creation.

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify when changes are pushed to the main branch.
