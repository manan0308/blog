## Hi!

I am Manan Agarwal.
Here's a bit about me and what I have done over the years.
I am currently in my third year of engineering, majoring in Mechatronics( Robotics and automation).

Having been intrigued by the Indian startup ecosystem ever since my first year, I decided to dive right into the action.
I interned at SpringWorks in a growth role to kick things off and learnt a lot on what it means to be a part of a high growth startup, how business metrics are defined, how products are shipped. Even built [this](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/springverify-s-reference-checker).

Read about product management following the SpringWorks stint and wanted to experience how Product teams run, so interned as a PM intern with Bounce.
At Bounce learnt how product teams meet business goals, scaled a project from zero to one that had an impact on the top line in a considerable way.

If you have read this till here, maybe you can will enjoy interacting with me more on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manan_0308) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mananagarwal03).
