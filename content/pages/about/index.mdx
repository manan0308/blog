## Hi!

I am Manan Agarwal, a 21 year living in Bangalore, India.

I work as an Associate Product Manger at Razorpay.  I have been at Razorpay for almost an year now and I am part of the [RazorpayX Payroll](https://razorpay.com/payroll) product team.

I recently also graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology majoring in Mechatronics Engineering (Robotics and automation).

### Here's a bit on what I have been upto over the past few years:

Having been intrigued by the Indian startup ecosystem ever since my first year, I decided to explore it to the fullest.
I interned at SpringWorks in a growth/founders office role to kick things off and learnt a lot on what it means to be a part of a high growth startup, how business metrics are defined, how products are shipped.

Read about product management following the SpringWorks stint and wanted to experience how Product teams run, so interned as a PM intern with Bounce.
At Bounce learnt how product teams meet business goals, scaled a project from zero to one that had an impact on the top line in a considerable way.

Following which, I was approached for a product management internship at Razorpay. More on it [here](https://www.mananagarwal.in/landing-at-razorpay). I ended up converting this to a full-time role as an APM.
