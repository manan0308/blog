Over the past year or so, multiple folks have reached out to me on how to break into the Product Management, this is a compilation of some of the best resources I have come across.

This is not an exhaustive list, but this should be more than enough for you to get started. If you want to add to this list or have any feedback for any of these resources, you can write to me on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/manan_0308)

## Books

A list of books that you definitely should read if you are considering breaking into PM are :

- Interviewing : Cracking the PM Interview (Lewis C Lin)
- Interviewing : Decode and Conquer (Lewis C Lin)
- Interviewing  : Secrets of a PM Interview (Lewis C Lin)
- Before you start your role as PM: Escaping the Built Trap (Melissa Perri)
- The Third Door  (Alex Banayan)

## The Interview Process

Note this varies massively from company to company but broadly this is how it is categorized:

Product management interviews have three main types of questions : 
- Product Questions
- Estimation Questions
- Business Strategy Questions

Practice applying frameworks to the questions. Understand the the frameworks given are not rigid and each section (user journey, user personas, product goals, etc) is a tool that can be applied when needed. The framework does not need to be followed exactly in order, learn how to apply different parts based on the question you are asked.
