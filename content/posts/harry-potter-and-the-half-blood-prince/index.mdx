What is PM?
* Intellectual curiosity, the ability to observe things and have an open mind, how you are affecting the problem that the user is trying to solve
* Identify TA/ identify natural behaviour
* Is your product creating a value/how badly do they need a product
* Is it a vitamin product vs painkiller product
* Power of storytelling is very important for user/stakeholder/team
* PM is both art and science
* Power of Observation is very important
* Not just how, ask why
* Going deeper is the art of PM, BE CURIOUS

On Growth:
Growth is primarily acquisition/retention/monetization

Acqusition: 
* Identify TA/Behaviour/where users are
* Essential get users to the product once
* PR helped AIRBNB
* Performance Modeliing
* Identify which channel user is coming from and identifying LTV
* Build compounding growth loops so 1 user brings 20 others

Retention:
*  Core focus of growth is in retention not acquisition
* Build trust in the product is the biggest retention hack
* Consistently deliver what it set to delivers
* DO THINGS THAT ARE UNSCALABLE AT THE BEGINNING, DO THEM TO TAKE YOU TO YOUR IDEAL SETUP
* AIRBNB founders identified their AHA moment as good pictures of the homes and built around them
* Airbnb employees themselves tried the homes
* Value of retention was tied into the acquisition channels
>When somebody pays you money, you get different engagement, thinking about monetization is important
