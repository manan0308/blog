# Self Pickup from Restaurants
This spec discusses about **(WHY)**, **(WHAT)**, **(WHEN)** needs to be built for initiating self pickup from restaurants. It does not discuss the technical implementation **(HOW)** for it.

Author:Manan Agarwal, Fictional PM of Swiggy

Last updated: November 10th, 2020



### Problem Statement:
Swiggy is evaluating if it should start pickup from restaurants as a new feature on it’s app.

You are the PM on the project, what do you do next?

* Please list down assumptions you have made

* How would you plan to launch the project?

* How will you evaluate success/failure of the launch






## Why should we build it?

* Competition parity

* Engagement/Retention metrics	

* OKRs (Vision: build better urban lifestyle)

* After the pandemic people are apprehensive of using delivery partners because of their multiple interaction with various elements in the system.


## Problem it solves



1. Wait in restaurant queues to place your order
2. Wait additionally for the order to be made
3. High delivery costs incurred during peak hours when ordering from near your home
4. Swiggy’s end reduces burn wrt rider costs


## Assumptions 
* Growth in gross volume of orders.

* Increase in the retention, DAU and corresponding lagging metrics eg: less time spend for in app ordering

* Major UX changes, on the customer side. (different swiggy pickup, like in blr airport)

* Consumers willing to trade picking orders to save time. 


## Main User Stories



*   As an office goer, I may pickup snacks/coffee/lunch/dinner based on time I go to office, thus reducing my total time elapsed to order and get food.
*   As a home-Maker, I’ll be able to bring food home on a regular basis for the family, since I do it almost everyday. 
*   As a college student, I don’t want to spend money on delivery charges and with a packed schedule I cannot wait for my order to get ready
*   As a restaurant owner, self ordering kiosks are very expensive and due to Covid I wouldn’t want multiple people using the same kiosk and hence your phone becomes a kiosk.


# Defining the goal of the feature:

Offering unparalleled convenience to urban consumers by eliminating the last mile time and introducing self pickup from restaurants allowing consumers to have maximum flexibility with respect to their order. 

Framework Used: DHM (Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin Enhancement)


## Potential metrics to  watch out for / impact 


*   Orders done daily
    *   For Bangalore, approximately 60% of all orders in a day form category 1, 10-15%  form category 2, additional 15% would form category 3 of people using our app \

*   Orders within distance
    *   Understanding from data how many orders have been placed within 1-2km radius of the consumer. A fair estimate would be that ~10% of all orders would fall in the under 1.5km range and ~25% would be under 500meters from restaurants.


## Success metrics

*  On restaurant end:
      
      *  Additional GMV generated by pick up(5-10% additional) 
      
  	  *  Completed Order per week in pickup mode (>24) 
	    
      *  Percentage of orders declined both normally + in peak hour (&lt;5%+&lt;2%) 
      
      *  Waiting Minutes (&lt;2mins) 
	    
      *  Decline in total # of delivery through delivery partners


*  On Consumer end:


		 
    
     *  Average basket size(>Rs 380) 
		
     *  Increase in DAU (7%)
     
     *  Weekly orders (>2)
